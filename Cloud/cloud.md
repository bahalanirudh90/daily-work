## The Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing

![Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing]

### 1. On-demand Self Service 🛠️
- Users can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service provider
- Example: Creating a new server instance with just a few clicks

### 2. Broad Network Access 🌐
- Resources available over the network, and can be accessed by diverse client platforms
- Access from laptop, mobile, tablet, anywhere with internet

### 3. Multi-tenancy and Resource Pooling 🏢
- Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy
- Multiple customers are serviced from the same physical resources

### 4. Rapid Elasticity and Scalability ⚡
- Automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources when needed
- Quickly and easily scale based on demand

### 5. Measured Service 💰
- Usage is measured, users pay correctly for what they have used
- Pay-per-use model with detailed billing

## Server & Network Architecture: The Building Blocks 🖥️📡

Before diving deeper into cloud services, let's understand what makes up a server and its network components—the foundation of all cloud computing!

### Server Components: The Digital Brain 🧠

Think of a server like a **human body with specialized organs** working together:

#### 1. Compute (CPU) - The Brain's Processing Power 🧠
- **What it does**: Executes instructions and performs calculations
- **Real-world analogy**: Like your brain processing thoughts
- **In pizza business**: The chef who follows recipes and makes decisions
- **Measurement**: GHz (speed), cores (parallel processing)
- **Cloud examples**: AWS: 2 vCPUs, 4 vCPUs, 8 vCPUs (like hiring 2, 4, or 8 chefs)

#### 2. Memory (RAM) - The Brain's Working Memory 🧠
- **What it does**: Temporarily stores data being actively used
- **Real-world analogy**: Your brain's short-term memory while cooking
- **In pizza business**: Counter space where chef keeps ingredients while cooking
- **Measurement**: GB (8GB, 16GB, 32GB)
- **Why important**: More RAM = can handle more simultaneous tasks

#### 3. Storage - The Digital Filing Cabinet 📁
- **What it does**: Permanently stores data, files, and applications
- **Real-world analogy**: Your kitchen pantry and recipe book storage
- **Types**:
  - **SSD (Solid State Drive)**: Fast but expensive (like keeping ingredients on counter)
  - **HDD (Hard Disk Drive)**: Slower but cheaper (like basement storage)
- **In cloud**: AWS EBS, Google Persistent Disks

#### 4. Database - Organized Data Storage 🗃️
- **What it does**: Stores data in structured, searchable format
- **Real-world analogy**: Organized recipe collection with index cards
- **Types**:
  - **Relational (SQL)**: MySQL, PostgreSQL - like organized filing system
  - **NoSQL**: MongoDB, DynamoDB - like flexible storage boxes
- **Why needed**: Raw storage is like throwing papers in a box, database is like organized filing

### Network Components: The Communication System 📡

#### 1. Routers - The Internet GPS 🗺️
- **What they do**: Forward data packets between different networks
- **Real-world analogy**: GPS navigation system for your car
- **In pizza business**: Delivery dispatcher who knows all the routes in the city
- **How they work**: Your Computer → Router → Internet Service Provider → Destination Server

#### 2. Switches - The Local Traffic Director 🚦
- **What they do**: Forward packets to correct device within same network
- **Real-world analogy**: Traffic officer directing cars within a neighborhood
- **In pizza business**: Kitchen manager directing orders to specific chefs
- **Difference from router**:
  - **Switch**: Connects devices in same network (your office)
  - **Router**: Connects different networks (your office to internet)

#### 3. DNS Server - The Internet Phone Book 📞
- **What it does**: Translates domain names to IP addresses
- **Real-world analogy**: Phone book that converts "John's Pizza" to actual phone number
- **Example**: google.com → 172.217.14.206
- **Why needed**: Humans remember names, computers use numbers

### How They All Work Together: Complete System Example 🍕

```
Customer Order Process:
1. Customer calls (DNS finds phone number)
2. Order reaches main office (Router directs to your network)
3. Receptionist routes to kitchen (Switch directs to right server)
4. Chef (CPU) processes order using recipe memory (RAM)
5. Gets ingredients from pantry (Storage)
6. Checks customer history (Database)
7. Prepares pizza and updates order status
```

### Server Architecture in Your Employee Management System 👥

```javascript
// Employee Management System Architecture

└─────────────────┬───────────────────────┘
                  │ Database Query
                  ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│            Database Server              │
│  Storage: Employee records, files       │
│  Database: Structured employee data     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
