## Date July 17, 2025

# What is testing
- Testing is the process of verifying that an application works as expected and is free of bugs.
- It ensures :
    - **Reliability**: How testing ensures reliability
        - **Consistent Behavior**: Tests verify that the application behaves the same way under similar conditions
        - **Error Handling**: Tests validate that the system gracefully handles unexpected inputs and edge cases
        - **Recovery Testing**: Ensures the system can recover from failures and continue operating
        - **Stress Testing**: Verifies the system remains stable under heavy load or adverse conditions
        - **Example**: Testing a banking app to ensure it processes transactions accurately every time, even during peak usage
    
    - **Quality**: How testing ensures quality
        - **Defect Detection**: Systematic testing finds bugs before they reach end users
        - **Requirement Validation**: Tests verify that all business requirements are correctly implemented
        - **User Experience Testing**: Ensures the application is intuitive and meets user expectations
        - **Code Quality**: Unit tests and code reviews ensure clean, maintainable code
        - **Compliance Testing**: Verifies adherence to industry standards and regulations
        - **Example**: Testing an e-commerce site to ensure all features work correctly, the UI is user-friendly, and payment processing is secure
    
    - **Performance**: How testing ensures performance
        - **Response Time Testing**: Measures how quickly the system responds to user actions
        - **Load Testing**: Verifies the system can handle expected user volumes
        - **Scalability Testing**: Ensures the system can grow to accommodate increased demand
        - **Resource Utilization**: Tests monitor CPU, memory, and network usage under various conditions
        - **Bottleneck Identification**: Performance testing reveals system limitations and optimization opportunities
        - **Example**: Testing a video streaming app to ensure it can serve 10,000 concurrent users with less than 2-second load times

- Testing ensures software quality by :
    - Finding bugs : Automated tests catch errors early
    - Verifying functionality : Confirms that features work as intended
    - Preventing regressions : These tests run after every change to ensure new code doesn't break the existing features.
    - Checking compatibility : To ensure consistent behaviors, tests are made to run on different browsers and platforms.
    - Improving reliability : Frequent testing increases confidence that the software will work consistently even under different conditiond or over time.

## 7 Testing Principles
- Testing shows the presence of defects, not their absence.However, it doesn't ensures that it is 100% bug-free.Reduced risk != Elimination of bugs.

- Exhaustive testing is impossible because testing all the combinations of inputs and paths is not feasible. So, we test what matters more.Like we can do priority-based or risk-based testing.

- Early testing saves time and money because catching the bugs in requirement/design phase is cheaper than fixing them later in production phase.

- Defects cluster together so it is highly possible that small number of modules often contain most of the defects (80:20cPareto Principle).We can focus more on unstable/high risk areas.Frequent bug areas deserve deeper regression tests.

- Beware of Pesticide Paradox because repeating the same tests will no longer find the new bugs.That is the reason that tests need to be reviewed and updated on regular basis.

- Testing is context-dependent so no one size fits all.Testing strategy should depend on the type of application like safety-critical softwares need stricter testing than a social media app.

- Absence of errors is a fallacy.Testing should verify both correctness and relevance to the business goals.A bug-free system is useless if it doesnot meet user needs. Functioning != Fit for purpose.

## Types of Testing
- Based on development phase :
    1. Unit Testing : Tests individual functions or methods
    2. Integration Testing : Tests interaction between modules.Ensures dataflow between components works.
    3. System Testing : End to end testing of the entire application.Validates complete system against the requirements.
    4. Acceptance Testing : Done by clients or QA to verify system meets business needs.Includes UAT,Alpha,Beta.
- Based on purpose :
    1. Functional Testing : Tests what the system does.Focuses on business logic and features.
        - Smoke Testing : 
            - Broad and shallow;User-manual
            - are my major functions working after I deploy a new build?
            - is the app even stable enough to test further?
            - focus is on core modules,must-have features,basic integrations.
            - Suppose our team pushed a new build.I will check :
                - login/signup
                - homepage loads
                - product listing appears
                - add to cart works
                - checkout page opens
        - Sanity Testing :
            - Narrow and shallow;User-manual
            - after a minor fix, are my specific functionalities working?
            - I made a change and I have to only test modules related to that change.
            - I fixed a bug in Password reset feature, I will check :
                - the password reset page loads
                - email gets sent
                - reset link works
                - can I set a new password
        - Regression Testing :
            - Broad and deep;Heavily automated
            - Did we break anything?
            - after code change, previously working functionalities work or not?
            - I added a new "Save for later" button.I will test "Save for later" button. For Retest,
                - add to cart
                - remove from cart
                - checkout
                - cart total calculations
                - product detail page
        - Exploratory Testing :
            - Testers explore the application freely, using their creativity and domain-knowledge(no scripts).
            - Finds critical defects that script-testing might miss.
            - Tests beyond the boundaries of the test cases.
            - Testing Chat/messaging app:
                - Sends a message with only emojis
                - Copy-paste entire webpage
                - Block a user and check if blocked person can still message
                - Try sending message in airplane mode and then go online.
                - drag and drop a file to a chat;Does it handle unknown file types?
    2. Non-Functional Testing : Tests how system behaves.
        - Performance Testing :
            - Tests how the system performs under a specific workload.
            - Focuses on speed, scalability, stability, and responsiveness.
            - Example: Checking how the application responds when 1,000 users log in simultaneously (Load Testing) or finding the breaking point by increasing users until it fails (Stress Testing).
        - Security Testing :
            - Uncovers vulnerabilities and ensures the application is protected from threats.
            - Focuses on data confidentiality, integrity, and authentication.
            - Example: Simulating an attack to find security holes (Penetration Testing) or checking for common vulnerabilities like SQL Injection.
        - Usability Testing :
            - Evaluates how easy and user-friendly the application is.
            - Focuses on the user's experience, ease of navigation, and clarity of the interface.
            - Example: Observing a new user trying to complete a task without instructions to see where they struggle.
        - Compatibility Testing :
            - Ensures the software works correctly across different environments.
            - Focuses on different browsers, operating systems, devices, and network conditions.
            - Example: Verifying that the website looks and functions the same on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
        - Accessibility Testing (a11y) :
            - Ensures the application is usable by people with disabilities.
            - Focuses on compliance with standards like WCAG, screen reader compatibility, and keyboard navigation.
            - Example: Verifying that all images have `alt` text and that a user can navigate the entire site using only the tab key.
        - Reliability Testing :
            - Measures the software's ability to perform without failure for a specified time in a given environment.
            - Focuses on stability and robustness over extended periods.
            - Example: Running an automated test suite continuously for 24 hours to detect memory leaks or crashes.
- Based on automation :
    1. Manual Testing :
        - Performed by human-testers.
        - Best for exploratory or Ad-hoc scenarios.
    2. Automation Testing :
        - Performed by scripts/tools.
        - Good for repetitive tasks.

- Based on Code Visibility :
    1. White-Box Testing :
        - **What it is**: Testing with full knowledge of the internal code structure, logic, and paths. Also known as clear-box or glass-box testing.
        - **Who does it**: Primarily developers during unit testing.
        - **Goal**: To ensure all internal paths of the code are exercised and to verify the flow of inputs and outputs through the application.
        - **Common Techniques**:
            - **Statement Coverage**: Aims to execute every single statement in the source code at least once.
            - **Branch Coverage (Decision Coverage)**: Aims to test every possible branch (e.g., `if-else`, `case`) from each decision point.
            - **Path Coverage**: Aims to test every possible path from the start to the end of a function. This is the most comprehensive but often impractical due to the high number of paths.
        - **Real Example**: Consider this Java function:
            ```java
            public String getTicketPrice(int age, boolean isStudent) {
                if (age < 18) {
                    return "$10"; // Path 1
                } else if (isStudent) {
                    return "$12"; // Path 2
                } else {
                    return "$15"; // Path 3
                }
            }
            ```
            - **Statement Coverage**: A single test like `getTicketPrice(17, false)` would cover the first branch and achieve statement coverage for the first `if` block, but not the others.
            - **Branch Coverage**: You would need at least two tests: `getTicketPrice(17, false)` to cover the `age < 18` branch, and `getTicketPrice(20, true)` to cover the `isStudent` branch. To be thorough, `getTicketPrice(25, false)` would cover the final `else` branch.
    2. Black-Box Testing :
        - **What it is**: Testing the application's functionality without any knowledge of the internal code. The focus is solely on inputs and expected outputs.
        - **Who does it**: Primarily QA testers.
        - **Goal**: To verify that the system meets functional requirements from a user's perspective.
        - **Common Techniques**:
            - **Equivalence Partitioning**: Divides input data into partitions of equivalent data. If one test case from a partition passes, it's assumed all others in that partition will also pass.
            - **Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)**: A technique that focuses on testing the "boundaries" between partitions. Defects often cluster around boundaries.
            - **Decision Table Testing**: Used for complex business logic where the output depends on multiple combinations of inputs.
        - **Real Example**: An input field for a discount accepts ages from 18 to 60.
            - **Equivalence Partitioning**:
                - Partition 1 (Invalid): `age < 18` (e.g., test with `10`)
                - Partition 2 (Valid): `18 <= age <= 60` (e.g., test with `35`)
                - Partition 3 (Invalid): `age > 60` (e.g., test with `70`)
            - **Boundary Value Analysis**:
                - Test the edges of the valid partition: `17, 18, 19` and `59, 60, 61`. This checks for common "off-by-one" errors.

    3. Grey-Box Testing :
        - **What it is**: A mix of White-Box and Black-Box testing where the tester has partial knowledge of the internal system (e.g., access to databases or design documents).
        - **Who does it**: Can be done by developers or QA testers with access to design documents or databases.
        - **Goal**: To find defects related to improper code structure or usage, often in integration scenarios.
        - **Common Techniques (especially for Integration Testing)**:
            - **Top-Down Integration**: Testing starts from the top-level modules and moves downwards. Lower-level modules that are not yet developed are replaced with **Stubs** (dummy code that simulates the module).
            - **Bottom-Up Integration**: Testing starts from the lowest-level modules and moves upwards. Higher-level modules that call the unit being tested are replaced with **Drivers** (dummy code that calls the lower-level module).
        - **Grey-Box Real Example**:
            - **Scenario**: Testing a "Create User" feature on a website.
            - **Black-Box part**: The tester uses the UI to fill out the registration form and clicks "Submit". They then try to log in with the new user's credentials.
            - **White-Box part**: The tester has access to the database. After submitting the form, they write a SQL query to directly check the `users` table.
            - **Grey-Box Test**: The tester verifies not just that the login works, but also that:
                - The `creation_date` column in the database was correctly set to the current timestamp.
                - The `password` field was properly hashed and not stored in plain text.
                - The `user_status` is correctly set to 'pending_verification'.
            This approach finds defects that are not visible purely through the UI.

## Test Design Techniques
- Test design techniques are systematic approaches to derive test cases from test conditions. They help ensure comprehensive test coverage and efficient testing.

### Black-Box Testing Techniques
- These techniques focus on testing functionality without knowledge of internal code structure.

#### 1. Equivalence Partitioning (EP)
- **Definition**: Divides input domain into classes of data from which test cases can be derived. All values in a partition should behave similarly.
- **Principle**: If one test case in a partition passes, all others in that partition should also pass.
- **Types of Partitions**:
  - **Valid Partitions**: Acceptable inputs that should work
  - **Invalid Partitions**: Unacceptable inputs that should be rejected

- **Example 1: Age Validation**
  ```
  Requirement: Age field accepts values from 18 to 65
  
  Partitions:
  P1 (Invalid): age < 18     → Test with: 10, 0, -5
  P2 (Valid):   18 ≤ age ≤ 65 → Test with: 25, 40, 55
  P3 (Invalid): age > 65     → Test with: 70, 100
  
  Test Cases:
  TC1: Enter age = 10      → Expected: Error message
  TC2: Enter age = 25      → Expected: Accepted
  TC3: Enter age = 70      → Expected: Error message
  ```

- **Example 2: Email Validation**
  ```
  Partitions:
  P1 (Valid):   Proper email format    → test@example.com
  P2 (Invalid): Missing @              → testexample.com
  P3 (Invalid): Missing domain         → test@
  P4 (Invalid): Special characters     → test@#$.com
  P5 (Invalid): Empty field           → ""
  ```

#### 2. Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)
- **Definition**: Focuses on testing at the boundaries of input domains, where errors typically occur.
- **Principle**: Test values at boundaries, just inside boundaries, and just outside boundaries.
- **Why Important**: Most defects occur at boundaries due to off-by-one errors.

- **BVA Rules**:
  - **Minimum boundary**: min-1, min, min+1
  - **Maximum boundary**: max-1, max, max+1

- **Example 1: Numeric Range (1-100)**
  ```
  Valid Range: 1 to 100
  
  Boundary Test Cases:
  - Lower boundary: 0 (invalid), 1 (valid), 2 (valid)
  - Upper boundary: 99 (valid), 100 (valid), 101 (invalid)
  
  Test Cases:
  TC1: Input = 0    → Expected: Error
  TC2: Input = 1    → Expected: Accepted
  TC3: Input = 2    → Expected: Accepted
  TC4: Input = 99   → Expected: Accepted
  TC5: Input = 100  → Expected: Accepted
  TC6: Input = 101  → Expected: Error
  ```

- **Example 2: Password Length (8-15 characters)**
  ```
  Valid Range: 8 to 15 characters
  
  Test Cases:
  TC1: 7 chars  → "1234567"     → Expected: Invalid
  TC2: 8 chars  → "12345678"    → Expected: Valid
  TC3: 9 chars  → "123456789"   → Expected: Valid
  TC4: 14 chars → "12345678901234" → Expected: Valid
  TC5: 15 chars → "123456789012345" → Expected: Valid
  TC6: 16 chars → "1234567890123456" → Expected: Invalid
  ```

#### 3. Decision Table Testing
- **Definition**: Used for complex business logic with multiple conditions and corresponding actions.
- **When to Use**: When system behavior depends on combinations of different inputs.
- **Components**:
  - **Conditions**: Input conditions or causes
  - **Actions**: Expected outcomes or effects
  - **Rules**: Combinations of conditions and their corresponding actions

- **Example: Login System**
  ```
  Conditions:
  C1: Valid Username (Y/N)
  C2: Valid Password (Y/N)
  C3: Account Active (Y/N)
  
  Actions:
  A1: Allow Login
  A2: Show "Invalid Credentials" error
  A3: Show "Account Suspended" error
  
  Decision Table:
  Rule#  | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
  -------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
  C1     | Y | Y | Y | Y | N | N | N | N |
  C2     | Y | Y | N | N | Y | Y | N | N |
  C3     | Y | N | Y | N | Y | N | Y | N |
  -------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
  A1     | X |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
  A2     |   |   | X |   | X |   | X |   |
  A3     |   | X |   |   |   | X |   |   |
  
  Test Cases:
  TC1: Valid user, valid pass, active account → Login success
  TC2: Valid user, valid pass, inactive account → Account suspended error
  TC3: Valid user, invalid pass, active account → Invalid credentials error
  ```

#### 4. State Transition Testing
- **Definition**: Tests how the system transitions from one state to another based on events.
- **When to Use**: For systems with different states and state-dependent behavior.
- **Components**:
  - **States**: Different conditions the system can be in
  - **Events**: Triggers that cause state changes
  - **Transitions**: Movement from one state to another

- **Example: ATM Machine States**
  ```
  States:
  S1: Card Inserted
  S2: PIN Entered
  S3: Account Selected
  S4: Transaction Complete
  
  Events:
  E1: Insert Card
  E2: Enter Valid PIN
  E3: Enter Invalid PIN
  E4: Select Account
  E5: Complete Transaction
  E6: Cancel
  
  Valid Transitions:
  Idle + E1 → S1 (Card Inserted)
  S1 + E2 → S2 (PIN Entered)
  S1 + E3 → Idle (Invalid PIN, card ejected)
  S2 + E4 → S3 (Account Selected)
  S3 + E5 → S4 (Transaction Complete)
  Any State + E6 → Idle (Cancel)
  ```

#### 5. Use Case Testing
- **Definition**: Derives test cases from use cases to ensure end-to-end functionality.
- **Focus**: Tests complete business scenarios from user perspective.

- **Example: Online Shopping Use Case**
  ```
  Use Case: Purchase Item
  
  Main Flow:
  1. User browses catalog
  2. User adds item to cart
  3. User proceeds to checkout
  4. User enters shipping info
  5. User enters payment info
  6. System processes payment
  7. System confirms order
  
  Test Scenarios:
  - Happy path: Complete purchase successfully
  - Alternative: User modifies cart during checkout
  - Exception: Payment fails
  - Exception: Item out of stock during checkout
  ```

#### 6. Error Guessing
- **Definition**: Ad-hoc technique based on tester's experience to guess potential error conditions.
- **When to Use**: As a supplement to formal techniques.

- **Common Error-Prone Areas**:
  - Division by zero
  - Null/empty inputs
  - Very large numbers
  - Special characters
  - Boundary conditions
  - Memory limitations

### White-Box Testing Techniques
- These techniques require knowledge of internal code structure.

#### 1. Statement Coverage
- **Definition**: Ensures every executable statement in the code is tested at least once.
- **Goal**: 100% statement coverage means every line of code is executed.

- **Example**:
  ```java
  public String gradeStudent(int marks) {
      String grade;
      if (marks >= 90) {        // Statement 1
          grade = "A";          // Statement 2
      } else if (marks >= 75) { // Statement 3
          grade = "B";          // Statement 4
      } else {                  // Statement 5
          grade = "C";          // Statement 6
      }
      return grade;             // Statement 7
  }
  
  Test Cases for 100% Statement Coverage:
  TC1: marks = 95  → Executes: 1, 2, 7
  TC2: marks = 80  → Executes: 1, 3, 4, 7
  TC3: marks = 60  → Executes: 1, 3, 5, 6, 7
  ```

#### 2. Branch Coverage (Decision Coverage)
- **Definition**: Ensures every possible branch from each decision point is executed.
- **Goal**: Test both TRUE and FALSE outcomes of every decision.

- **Example**:
  ```java
  public boolean isEligible(int age, boolean hasLicense) {
      if (age >= 18 && hasLicense) {    // Decision Point
          return true;                   // Branch 1 (TRUE)
      } else {
          return false;                  // Branch 2 (FALSE)
      }
  }
  
  Test Cases for 100% Branch Coverage:
  TC1: age = 20, hasLicense = true  → TRUE branch
  TC2: age = 16, hasLicense = true  → FALSE branch
  TC3: age = 20, hasLicense = false → FALSE branch
  ```

#### 3. Condition Coverage
- **Definition**: Tests all individual conditions in decision statements.
- **Goal**: Each boolean sub-expression should be evaluated to both TRUE and FALSE.

- **Example**:
  ```java
  if (age >= 18 && hasLicense && !suspended) {
      // Conditions: (age >= 18), hasLicense, (!suspended)
  }
  
  Test Cases:
  TC1: age=20, hasLicense=true, suspended=false  → T && T && T
  TC2: age=16, hasLicense=false, suspended=true  → F && F && F
  TC3: age=20, hasLicense=false, suspended=false → T && F && T
  TC4: age=16, hasLicense=true, suspended=true   → F && T && F
  ```

#### 4. Path Coverage
- **Definition**: Ensures every possible path through the code is executed.
- **Goal**: Test all possible combinations of branches.

- **Example**:
  ```java
  public String calculateDiscount(int age, boolean isMember) {
      String discount = "0%";
      
      if (age >= 60) {              // Path 1
          discount = "Senior: 20%";
      } else if (isMember) {        // Path 2
          discount = "Member: 10%";
      } else {                      // Path 3
          discount = "No discount";
      }
      
      return discount;
  }
  
  All Possible Paths:
  Path 1: age >= 60 → "Senior: 20%"
  Path 2: age < 60 && isMember → "Member: 10%"
  Path 3: age < 60 && !isMember → "No discount"
  
  Test Cases:
  TC1: age = 65, isMember = true  → Path 1
  TC2: age = 30, isMember = true  → Path 2
  TC3: age = 30, isMember = false → Path 3
  ```

### Grey-Box Testing Techniques
- Combines black-box and white-box approaches.

#### 1. Matrix Testing
- **Definition**: Tests interactions between different system components.
- **Focus**: Integration points and data flow between modules.

#### 2. Regression Testing
- **Definition**: Re-runs existing tests to ensure new changes don't break existing functionality.
- **Types**:
  - **Corrective**: After bug fixes
  - **Progressive**: After new feature additions
  - **Selective**: Run subset of tests
  - **Complete**: Run all tests

#### 3. Pattern Testing
- **Definition**: Tests based on common failure patterns and past defect history.

### Experience-Based Testing Techniques

#### 1. Exploratory Testing
- **Definition**: Simultaneous learning, test design, and execution.
- **Approach**: Investigate the application while testing.

#### 2. Ad-hoc Testing
- **Definition**: Informal testing without specific test cases.
- **When**: To find defects through random testing.

#### 3. Checklist-Based Testing
- **Definition**: Uses predefined checklists to guide testing.
- **Example Checklist for Web Forms**:
  ```
  □ All mandatory fields marked with *
  □ Field validation works correctly
  □ Error messages are clear and helpful
  □ Submit button works properly
  □ Reset/Cancel button works
  □ Form handles special characters
  □ Form prevents SQL injection
  □ Form accessible via keyboard navigation
  ```

### Technique Selection Guidelines

   - **High-risk systems**: Use formal techniques (EP, BVA, Decision Tables)
   - **Time constraints**: Use exploratory and error guessing
   - **Regulatory compliance**: Use systematic approaches

2. **Application Type**:
   - **Calculation-heavy**: BVA, EP
   - **Workflow-based**: State transition, Use case testing
   - **Rule-based**: Decision table testing
   - **User interfaces**: Exploratory, checklist-based

3. **Team Experience**:
   - **Experienced testers**: Error guessing, exploratory
   - **New testers**: Systematic techniques (EP, BVA)

4. **Available Information**:
   - **Code available**: White-box techniques
   - **Requirements only**: Black-box techniques
   - **Limited documentation**: Experience-based techniques

### Best Practices for Test Design
- **Combine Techniques**: Use multiple techniques for comprehensive coverage
- **Risk-Based Selection**: Focus on high-risk areas first

- **Review Test Cases**: Peer review improves quality
- **Update Regularly**: Keep test cases current with requirements
- **Document Assumptions**: Record any assumptions made during design
## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
- The SDLC is a structured process that defines the tasks performed at each step in the software development process. It provides a framework for planning, creating, testing, and deploying high-quality software.

### Key Phases of SDLC
1.  **Requirement Gathering and Analysis**: Collecting requirements from stakeholders to understand what the system should do.
2.  **Design**: Creating the system architecture and software design based on the requirements.
3.  **Implementation or Coding**: Writing the actual code for the software.
4.  **Testing**: Verifying and validating that the software is bug-free and meets the requirements.
5.  **Deployment**: Releasing the software to the production environment for users.
6.  **Maintenance**: Making modifications to the software after release to fix bugs, improve performance, or add features.

### Popular SDLC Models
- Different models are used based on the project's complexity, scope, and requirements.
    - **Waterfall Model**:
        - A linear, sequential approach where each phase must be fully completed before the next begins.
        - **Pros**: Simple and easy to manage.
        - **Cons**: Inflexible; no room for changing requirements once a phase is complete.
        - **Best for**: Small projects with clear, well-documented, and fixed requirements.
    - **V-Model (Verification & Validation Model)**:
        - An extension of the Waterfall model where a testing phase is planned in parallel with each development phase (e.g., unit testing is planned with the coding phase).
        - **Pros**: Emphasizes early test planning, which helps find defects at an early stage.
        - **Cons**: Still rigid and not flexible for requirement changes.
    - **Iterative Model**:
        - The development process is broken into small, repeated cycles (iterations). A new, working version of the software is produced at the end of each iteration.
        - **Pros**: Produces a working version early in the cycle; more flexible than Waterfall.
        - **Cons**: Can be complex to manage all the iterations.
    - **Agile Model**:
        - An iterative and incremental approach that emphasizes flexibility, customer collaboration, and rapid delivery of working software in small increments (sprints).
        - **Pros**: Highly flexible and adaptive to changing requirements; promotes strong teamwork.
        - **Cons**: Less predictable in terms of final deadlines and costs.
        - **Examples**: Scrum, Kanban. This is the most widely used model in the industry today.
    - **Spiral Model**:
        - Combines elements of the iterative model with the risk analysis of the Waterfall model. It's used for large, complex, and high-risk projects.
        - **Pros**: Excellent for risk management.
        - **Cons**: Very complex and can be expensive.

## Key Scrum Terminologies for Testers
- Since most teams use the **Agile** model, understanding the language of **Scrum** (the most popular Agile framework) is essential.
    - **Sprint**: A short, time-boxed period (usually 1-4 weeks) where the team works to complete a set amount of work.
    - **Product Backlog**: A prioritized list of all features, enhancements, and fixes desired for the product. It's the single source of requirements.
    - **Sprint Backlog**: A subset of items from the Product Backlog that the team commits to completing in a specific Sprint.
    - **User Story**: A short, simple description of a feature from the perspective of the user. It follows the format: "As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason]."
    - **Definition of Done (DoD)**: A formal checklist of criteria that a User Story must meet to be considered "done." For a tester, this is critical and often includes "All acceptance tests passed," "Regression tests passed," and "No critical bugs found."
    - **Daily Stand-up (or Daily Scrum)**: A short (15-minute) daily meeting for the team to sync up. Each member answers: What did I do yesterday? What will I do today? What impediments are in my way?
    - **Sprint Review**: A meeting at the end of the Sprint where the team demonstrates what they accomplished (the working software) to stakeholders to get feedback.
    - **Sprint Retrospective**: A meeting at the end of the Sprint for the team to reflect internally on the process. They discuss what went well, what didn't, and what to improve for the next Sprint.

## Test Metrics
- Test metrics are quantitative measures that help monitor and control the software testing process. They provide insights into the quality of the product, the effectiveness of the testing, and the overall progress.
    - **Test Coverage**: The percentage of requirements, code, or features that are covered by test cases. (e.g., "We have 90% code coverage from our unit tests.")
        - **Formula**: `(Number of items covered / Total number of items) * 100`
    - **Defect Density**: The number of confirmed defects found in a component or system, divided by the size of that component (e.g., measured in lines of code or function points). It helps identify which modules are the most buggy.
        - **Formula**: `Total number of defects / Size of the software module`
    - **Defect Leakage**: The percentage of defects that were missed in a testing phase and found in a later phase (or by the customer). A high leakage from QA to Production is a major red flag.
        - **Formula**: `(Defects found in a later phase / (Defects found in current phase + Defects found in later phase)) * 100`. For example, leakage from QA to UAT is `(Defects in UAT / (Defects in QA + Defects in UAT)) * 100`.
    - **Test Execution Rate**: The percentage of test cases that have been executed out of the total number of planned tests.
        - **Formula**: `(Number of executed tests / Total number of tests) * 100`
    - **Test Pass Rate**: The percentage of tests that passed out of the total number of executed tests.
        - **Formula**: `(Number of passed tests / Number of executed tests) * 100`
    - **Mean Time To Detect (MTTD)**: The average time it takes to discover a defect from the moment it was introduced.
        - **Formula**: `Sum of (Time of Detection - Time of Introduction) for all defects / Total number of defects`
    - **Mean Time To Repair (MTTR)**: The average time it takes to fix a defect once it has been identified.
        - **Formula**: `Sum of (Time of Resolution - Time of Reporting) for all defects / Total number of defects`

## The Bug Life Cycle
- This cycle describes the journey of a defect from its discovery to its resolution. The exact states can vary between teams, but this is a common flow, often managed in tools like Jira.
    1.  **New**: A tester finds a bug and reports it with detailed information (steps to reproduce, screenshots, logs). The bug is now in the system.
    2.  **Assigned**: The project lead or manager assigns the bug to a developer for analysis.
    3.  **Open**: The developer accepts the bug and starts working on a fix.
    4.  **Fixed**: The developer has implemented a fix and deployed it to the test environment.
    5.  **Pending Retest**: The bug is assigned back to the tester to verify the fix.
    6.  **Retest**: The tester performs retesting to confirm that the original bug has been fixed.
    7.  **Verified**: The tester confirms the fix works as expected.
    8.  **Closed**: The bug is officially considered resolved.
    - **Other Possible States**:
        - **Reopened**: If the tester finds that the fix did not work, the bug goes back to the developer.
        - **Rejected/Invalid**: The developer determines that the reported issue is not a valid bug (e.g., it's intended behavior or a misunderstanding of the requirements).
        - **Deferred**: The bug is valid, but the fix is postponed for a future release due to low priority or other business reasons.
        - **Duplicate**: The bug has already been reported by someone else.

## Critical Test Scenarios
- Critical test scenarios are the most important test cases that verify core business functionalities. These tests must pass for the application to be considered stable and ready for release.

### Characteristics of Critical Test Scenarios

## Test Estimation Techniques
- Test estimation is the process of predicting the effort, time, and resources required to complete testing activities. Accurate estimation is crucial for project planning, resource allocation, and setting realistic expectations.

### What is Test Estimation? (Beginner's Guide)
Think of test estimation like planning a cooking project:
- **What you're cooking**: The application features to test
- **How long it takes**: Time needed for each testing activity
- **Who's helping**: Number of testers required
- **What you need**: Tools, environment, and resources

**Real-world analogy**: If you're testing a simple login page, you might estimate:
- Writing test cases: 2 hours
- Setting up test environment: 1 hour
- Executing tests: 3 hours
- Reporting bugs: 1 hour
- **Total**: 7 hours

### Why Test Estimation is Important
- **Project Planning**: Helps in creating realistic project timelines and milestones
- **Resource Allocation**: Determines how many testers are needed and for how long
- **Budget Planning**: Estimates costs for testing activities
- **Risk Management**: Identifies potential bottlenecks and resource constraints
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Sets proper expectations with management and clients
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensures adequate time is allocated for thorough testing

### Simple Example for Beginners
**Scenario**: You need to test a basic e-commerce website with these features:
- User registration
- Login/Logout
- Product search
- Add to cart
- Checkout

**Basic Estimation**:
```
Feature              | Test Cases | Time per Test | Total Time
---------------------|------------|---------------|------------
User Registration    |     5      |    30 min     |  2.5 hours
Login/Logout         |     3      |    20 min     |  1 hour
Product Search       |     8      |    25 min     |  3.3 hours
Add to Cart          |     6      |    30 min     |  3 hours
Checkout             |    10      |    45 min     |  7.5 hours
---------------------|------------|---------------|------------
TOTAL                |    32      |      -        | 17.3 hours
```

**Add buffer for unexpected issues**: 17.3 + 20% = **~21 hours**

### Common Test Estimation Techniques (With Beginner Examples)

#### 1. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) - "Break it Down!"
- **What it is**: Break down testing activities into smaller, manageable tasks and estimate each individually
- **Think of it like**: Planning a birthday party - break it into smaller tasks (decorations, food, invitations)

- **How it works**:
  1. Identify all testing activities (test planning, test case design, test execution, etc.)
  2. Break each activity into smaller tasks
  3. Estimate effort for each small task
  4. Sum up all estimates

- **Beginner Example: Testing a Simple Calculator App**:

#### 2. Expert Judgment - "Ask the Experienced!"
- **What it is**: Ask experienced testers who have worked on similar projects
- **Think of it like**: Asking your mom how long it takes to cook a dish she's made many times

- **How it works**:
  1. Find experts who worked on similar projects
  2. Show them your project details
  3. Get estimates from 2-3 experts
  4. Discuss differences and agree on final estimate

- **Beginner Example**:
  ```
  Project: Testing a mobile app
  
  Expert A (5 years experience): "Based on similar apps, this will take 80 hours"
  Expert B (8 years experience): "I think 100 hours, mobile testing is tricky"
  Expert C (3 years experience): "Around 90 hours seems right"
  
  Team Discussion Result: 90 hours (average + considering mobile complexity)
  ```

#### 3. Three-Point Estimation (PERT) - "Best, Worst, Most Likely"
- **What it is**: Consider three scenarios - best case, worst case, and most likely case
- **Think of it like**: Planning travel time - fastest route, traffic jam scenario, normal traffic
- **Formula**: `Expected Time = (Best + 4 × Most Likely + Worst) / 6`

- **Beginner Example: Testing User Login Feature**:
  ```
  Task: Login Feature Testing
  
  Best Case (O): 4 hours (everything works perfectly, no bugs)
  Most Likely (M): 8 hours (normal testing, few minor bugs)
  Worst Case (P): 16 hours (many bugs, complex issues)
  
  Calculation:
  Expected Time = (4 + 4×8 + 16) / 6
                = (4 + 32 + 16) / 6
                = 52 / 6
                = 8.7 hours
  
  Final Estimate: 9 hours (rounded up)
  ```

#### 4. Analogous Estimation - "Similar Project Comparison"
- **What it is**: Use data from similar past projects as a starting point
- **Think of it like**: "Last time I painted a similar room, it took 6 hours, so this room should take about the same"

- **How it works**:
  1. Find a similar past project
  2. Look at how much effort was spent
  3. Adjust for differences in current project

- **Beginner Example**:
  ```
  Previous Project: E-commerce website testing
  - 50 test cases
  - 120 hours total effort
  - Rate: 120/50 = 2.4 hours per test case
  
  Current Project: Similar e-commerce site
  - 75 test cases (50% more)
  - Basic estimate: 75 × 2.4 = 180 hours
  
  Adjustments:
  - New team (+20%): 180 × 1.2 = 216 hours
  - Better tools (-10%): 216 × 0.9 = 194 hours
  
  Final Estimate: 194 hours
  ```

#### 5. Function Point Analysis - "Count the Features"
- **What it is**: Count application features and estimate based on complexity
- **Think of it like**: Counting rooms in a house to estimate cleaning time

- **Simple Steps**:
  1. Count inputs (forms, data entry screens)
  2. Count outputs (reports, screens showing data)
  3. Count files (databases, data storage)
  4. Apply complexity weights
  5. Calculate total effort

- **Beginner Example: Simple Banking App**:
  ```
  Features to Count:
  - Simple Inputs: Login form, Transfer money form = 2 × 3 points = 6
  - Complex Inputs: Account opening form = 1 × 6 points = 6
  - Simple Outputs: Account balance display = 1 × 4 points = 4
  - Complex Outputs: Transaction history report = 1 × 7 points = 7
  
  Total Function Points: 6 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 23 points
  
  If team productivity = 3 hours per function point:
  Total Effort = 23 × 3 = 69 hours
  ```

#### 6. Story Point Estimation (Agile) - "Relative Sizing"
- **What it is**: Estimate features relative to each other, not absolute time
- **Think of it like**: Comparing T-shirt sizes (S, M, L, XL) instead of exact measurements

- **How it works**:
  1. Pick a reference story (baseline)
  2. Compare other stories to it
  3. Use Fibonacci numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)

- **Beginner Example: Testing User Stories**:
  ```
  Reference Story: "User can login" = 3 points
  
  Other Stories:
  - "User can logout" = 1 point (much simpler than login)
  - "User can register" = 5 points (more complex than login)
  - "User can reset password" = 8 points (much more complex)
  - "User can view profile" = 2 points (simpler than login)
  
  Planning Poker Session:
  Team discusses each story and agrees on points using voting
  ```

#### 7. Simple Time-Boxing Approach (Perfect for Beginners)
- **What it is**: Allocate fixed time boxes for different types of testing activities
- **Think of it like**: Setting a timer for each activity

- **Beginner Template**:
  ```
  For any feature testing:
  - Understanding requirements: 10% of total time
  - Writing test cases: 25% of total time
  - Setting up test environment: 15% of total time
  - Executing tests: 35% of total time
  - Bug reporting and retesting: 15% of total time
  
  Example: If you have 20 hours for testing a feature:
  - Requirements: 2 hours
  - Test cases: 5 hours
  - Environment: 3 hours
  - Execution: 7 hours
  - Bug work: 3 hours
  Total: 20 hours
  ```
  4. Sum up all estimates

- **Example WBS for Login Module**:
  ```
  Login Module Testing (40 hours)
  ├── Test Planning (4 hours)
  │   ├── Requirement analysis (2 hours)
  │   └── Test strategy creation (2 hours)
  ├── Test Design (16 hours)
  │   ├── Positive test cases (6 hours)
  │   ├── Negative test cases (6 hours)
  │   └── Edge cases (4 hours)
  ├── Test Execution (16 hours)
  │   ├── Manual testing (12 hours)
  │   └── Regression testing (4 hours)
  └── Test Reporting (4 hours)
      ├── Defect reporting (2 hours)
      └── Test summary report (2 hours)
  ```

#### 2. Expert Judgment
- **What it is**: Leverage experience of senior team members or domain experts
- **How it works**:
  1. Identify experts who have worked on similar projects
  2. Present the project details to experts
  3. Collect estimates from multiple experts
  4. Discuss variations and reach consensus

- **Best Practices**:
  - Use multiple experts to avoid bias
  - Consider both optimistic and pessimistic scenarios
  - Document assumptions and reasoning
  - Regular re-estimation as project progresses

#### 3. Three-Point Estimation (PERT)
- **What it is**: Uses optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely estimates to calculate expected effort
- **Formula**: `Expected Effort = (Optimistic + 4 × Most Likely + Pessimistic) / 6`

- **Example**:
  ```
  Task: Test Case Design for User Registration
  Optimistic (O): 8 hours (everything goes perfectly)
  Most Likely (M): 12 hours (normal conditions)
  Pessimistic (P): 20 hours (everything goes wrong)
  
  Expected Effort = (8 + 4×12 + 20) / 6 = 76 / 6 = 12.67 hours
  ```

#### 4. Analogous Estimation
- **What it is**: Use historical data from similar projects as a baseline
- **How it works**:
  1. Identify similar past projects
  2. Analyze effort spent on testing activities
  3. Adjust for differences in current project
  4. Apply scaling factors

- **Example**:
  ```
  Previous E-commerce Project: 200 hours for 50 test cases
  Current Project: 75 test cases (50% more)
  Base Estimate: 200 × 1.5 = 300 hours
  Complexity Adjustment: +20% = 360 hours
  Team Experience Adjustment: -10% = 324 hours
  ```

#### 5. Function Point Analysis
- **What it is**: Estimate based on functional complexity of the application
- **Steps**:
  1. Count function points (inputs, outputs, files, interfaces, queries)
  2. Apply complexity weights
  3. Calculate total function points
  4. Use historical productivity data

- **Example**:
  ```
  Simple Inputs: 10 × 3 = 30 points
  Complex Inputs: 5 × 6 = 30 points
  Simple Outputs: 8 × 4 = 32 points
  Total Function Points: 92
  
  If team productivity = 2 hours per function point
  Total Effort = 92 × 2 = 184 hours
  ```

#### 6. Use Case Point Method
- **What it is**: Estimate based on use cases and actors in the system
- **Process**:
  1. Count and classify use cases (simple, average, complex)
  2. Count and classify actors (simple, average, complex)
  3. Apply weights and calculate unadjusted use case points
  4. Apply technical and environmental factors
  5. Convert to effort using productivity factors

#### 7. Story Point Estimation (Agile)
- **What it is**: Relative estimation technique using story points
- **How it works**:
  1. Define reference stories with known complexity
  2. Compare new features to reference stories
  3. Assign story points based on relative complexity
  4. Use team velocity to convert to time

- **Planning Poker**:
  - Team estimates stories using Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)
  - Everyone reveals estimates simultaneously
  - Discuss differences and re-estimate until consensus

### Beginner's Step-by-Step Estimation Process

#### Step 1: Understand What You're Testing
- **Questions to ask**:
  - What type of application? (Web, mobile, desktop)
  - How many features need testing?
  - Are there integrations with other systems?
  - What browsers/devices to test on?

- **Example**: 
  ```
  Project: Online Pizza Ordering Website
  - Type: Web application
  - Features: 8 main features (login, browse menu, order, payment, etc.)
  - Integrations: Payment gateway, email system
  - Browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari
  - Devices: Desktop and mobile
  ```

#### Step 2: List All Testing Activities
- **Basic activities every project needs**:
  ```
  1. Requirement Analysis (understand what to test)
  2. Test Planning (create strategy)
  3. Test Case Writing (detailed test steps)
  4. Test Environment Setup (prepare test systems)
  5. Test Execution (run the tests)
  6. Bug Reporting (document issues found)
  7. Retesting (verify bug fixes)
  8. Final Reporting (summary of results)
  ```

#### Step 3: Apply Simple Estimation Rules (Beginner-Friendly)
- **Rule of Thumb for beginners**:
  ```
  Small Feature (like login):        8-16 hours
  Medium Feature (like shopping cart): 16-32 hours  
  Large Feature (like payment system): 32-64 hours
  Very Large (like admin dashboard):   64+ hours
  ```

- **Quick estimation formula**:
  ```
  Base Effort = (Number of test cases × Average time per test case)
  
  Average time per test case:
  - Simple test: 15-30 minutes
  - Medium test: 30-60 minutes  
  - Complex test: 1-2 hours
  
  Example:
  Login feature: 10 test cases × 30 minutes = 5 hours
  Add 20% buffer: 5 × 1.2 = 6 hours
  ```

#### Step 4: Review and Adjust
- **Common adjustments**:
  ```
  Team Experience:
  - Experienced team: -10% to -20%
  - New team: +20% to +50%
  
  Project Complexity:
  - Simple app: Use base estimate
  - Complex app: +30% to +50%
  
  Timeline Pressure:
  - Tight deadline: Focus on critical tests only
  - Relaxed timeline: Add comprehensive testing
  ```

### Practical Estimation Example for Beginners

**Scenario**: You're a new tester asked to estimate testing for a simple blog website

**Features to test**:
1. User registration
2. User login/logout  
3. Create blog post
4. Edit blog post
5. Delete blog post
6. Comment on posts
7. Search posts

**Step-by-step estimation**:

```
Step 1: Categorize features by complexity
- Simple: Login/logout, Delete post (2 features)
- Medium: Registration, Create post, Edit post, Comment (4 features)  
- Complex: Search (1 feature)

Step 2: Estimate using rules of thumb
- Simple features: 2 × 12 hours = 24 hours
- Medium features: 4 × 24 hours = 96 hours
- Complex features: 1 × 48 hours = 48 hours
- Subtotal: 168 hours

Step 3: Add testing activities overhead (30%)
- Test planning: 20 hours
- Environment setup: 15 hours  
- Bug fixing/retesting: 25 hours
- Reporting: 10 hours
- Overhead total: 70 hours

Step 4: Calculate total
- Testing: 168 hours
- Overhead: 70 hours
- Total: 238 hours

Step 5: Add buffer for uncertainties (20%)
- Final estimate: 238 × 1.2 = 286 hours

Step 6: Convert to work days
- 286 hours ÷ 8 hours/day = 36 work days
- For 1 tester: 36 days (about 7-8 weeks)
- For 2 testers: 18 days (about 4 weeks)
```

### Common Beginner Mistakes to Avoid

#### ❌ Don't Do This:
1. **Estimating only test execution time**
   - Missing: test case writing, environment setup, bug reporting

2. **Forgetting about retesting** 
   - When bugs are fixed, you need time to verify the fixes

3. **Not adding buffer time**
   - Things always take longer than expected

4. **Ignoring team experience**
   - New team members need more time to learn

5. **Underestimating environment issues**
   - Setting up test environments often takes longer than expected

#### ✅ Do This Instead:
1. **Include all activities in estimation**
2. **Always add 15-25% buffer time**
3. **Consider team skill level**
4. **Plan for environment setup time**
5. **Account for bug fixing cycles**

## About Selenium
- Selenium is an open-source automation tool for web browsers.It helps by automating browser actions,running tests quickliy and repeatedly.It supports muliple browsers and integrates with different test frameworks like JUnit and TestNG.
- It is a Functional testing tool to test web-based applications.
- There are four components of Selenium :
    - Selenium IDE : It is a record and playback tool(a browser extension).It is good for beginners for quick prototyping.
    * It lacks database support and dynamic element handling.
    - Selenium RC : It is an older component for controlling browsers remotely (replaced by WebDriver)
    - Selenium WebDriver : It is the core tool for automating browser actions. It interacts directly with browsers
    - Selenium Grid : Allows running tests on multiple machines and browsers in parallel for faster and distributed testing.

## History of Selenium
- Selenium Core (Jason Huggins, 2004) : The original JavaScript based testing tool
- Selenium RC (Paul Hammant, 2005) : Added a server to bypass browser  security restrictions.
*Selenium RC bypassed the same origin policy by acting as a proxy server between the browser and the web application. The same origin policy is a browser security feature that restricts scripts from interacting with content from a different domain. Selenium RC’s proxy injected JavaScript into the browser, allowing it to automate actions across different domains, which would normally be blocked by the browser’s security rules. This workaround is one reason RC was used before WebDriver, which interacts with browsers at a lower level and does not need to bypass the same origin policy.WebDriver allows JavaScript injection on the current page, but it cannot break browser security rules to access other domains like Selenium RC’s proxy could.*
- Selenium IDE (Shinya Kasatani, 2006) : Firefox extension for recording and playing back tests.
- Selenium Grid (Patrick Lightboody, 2008) : Enabled parallel test execution across multiple machines.
- Selenium WebDriver (Simon Stewart, 2006(CONCEPT)->2009) : Direct browser automation , became the main Selenium tool after merging.

## WebDriver over RC
- Direct browser control : WebDriver interacts with browsers natively, making tests faster and more reliable.
- Supports modern browsers : WebDriver works with the latest browsers and standards.
- No need for a seperate server : Unlike RC, WebDriver doesnot require a proxy server to run tests.
- Better API : WebDriver provides a simpler, more intuitive API for writing tests.
- Handles dynamic webpages : WebDriver can work with AJAX and JavaScript-heavy applications more effectively.
- Improved performance : Tests run faster and with fewer compatibility issues.

## Automation Testing Frameworks
- A testing framework provides a set of guidelines, rules, and tools for creating and designing test cases. It helps standardize the testing process and makes test automation more efficient and reusable.
- Popular frameworks for Java include JUnit and TestNG, which are often used with Selenium.

### JUnit
- The most popular and widely-used unit testing framework for Java.
- **Key Features**:
    - **Annotations**: Uses annotations like `@Test`, `@BeforeEach`, `@AfterEach` to identify and structure test methods.
    - **Assertions**: Provides `Assertions` methods (e.g., `assertEquals()`, `assertTrue()`) to verify test outcomes.
    - **Test Runners**: Manages the execution of test cases.
- **Best for**: Unit testing, where simplicity and ease of use are important.

### TestNG
- A more powerful testing framework inspired by JUnit, but with additional features designed for broader testing needs (unit, functional, integration, end-to-end). "NG" stands for "Next Generation".
- **Key Features**:
    - **Advanced Annotations**: Includes more granular setup/teardown annotations like `@BeforeSuite`, `@BeforeTest`, `@BeforeClass`, and `@BeforeMethod`.
    - **Parallel Execution**: Natively supports running tests in parallel, which significantly speeds up the test suite.
    - **Test Dependencies**: Allows you to define dependencies between test methods (e.g., a test runs only if another one succeeds).
    - **Parameterization**: Easily pass parameters to test methods from an XML configuration file (`testng.xml`).
    - **Grouping**: Organize tests into groups (e.g., "smoke", "regression") and run specific groups.
- **Best for**: Complex testing scenarios, integration testing, and end-to-end testing where features like parallel execution and advanced test configuration are crucial.

### JUnit vs. TestNG Annotations
- Annotations are metadata that you add to your code to tell the framework how to run your tests. Here’s a comparison of the most common annotations in JUnit 5 and TestNG.

| Annotation Purpose                                       | JUnit 5 (`org.junit.jupiter.api.*`) | TestNG (`org.testng.annotations.*`)                               |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Marks a method as a test case                            | `@Test`                             | `@Test`                                                           |
| Runs **before each** test method                         | `@BeforeEach`                       | `@BeforeMethod`                                                   |
| Runs **after each** test method                          | `@AfterEach`                        | `@AfterMethod`                                                    |
| Runs once **before all** tests in the class              | `@BeforeAll` (must be static)       | `@BeforeClass`                                                    |
| Runs once **after all** tests in the class               | `@AfterAll` (must be static)        | `@AfterClass`                                                     |
| Runs before any test in a `<test>` tag in `testng.xml`   | *N/A*                               | `@BeforeTest`                                                     |
| Runs after all tests in a `<test>` tag in `testng.xml`   | *N/A*                               | `@AfterTest`                                                      |
| Runs once **before all** tests in the suite              | *N/A*                               | `@BeforeSuite`                                                    |
| Runs once **after all** tests in the suite               | *N/A*                               | `@AfterSuite`                                                     |

| Provides data for parameterized tests                    | `@ParameterizedTest` (with sources) | `@DataProvider`                                                   |

As you can see, TestNG offers a more granular test execution lifecycle with Suite and Test-level annotations, which is why it's often preferred for complex integration and end-to-end test suites.

### Deep Dive: TestNG's @DataProvider
- The `@DataProvider` annotation is used to run the same test method multiple times with different data sets. This approach is called **Data-Driven Testing**.

- **How it works:**
    1.  You create a method and annotate it with `@DataProvider(name = "your-provider-name")`.
    2.  This method returns a 2D object array (`Object[][]`), where each inner array (`Object[]`) represents one set of test data for your test method.
    3.  You create a test method and link it to the data provider using `@Test(dataProvider = "your-provider-name")`.
    4.  The parameters of your test method will receive the data from the provider. TestNG will run the test once for each inner array in the data set.

- **When to use it?**
    - When you need to test the same functionality with many different inputs.
    - **Examples**:
        - Testing a login form with multiple combinations of valid and invalid usernames and passwords.
        - Testing a search function with various search terms.
        - Testing a calculation function with different input numbers and expected results.

- **Example:**
    - Here's how you would test a login feature with two different sets of credentials.

    ```java
    import org.testng.annotations.DataProvider;
    import org.testng.annotations.Test;
    import org.testng.Assert;

    public class LoginTest {

        // 1. Create the Data Provider method
        @DataProvider(name = "loginCredentials")
        public Object[][] provideLoginData() {
            return new Object[][] {
                { "user@example.com", "password123", true },  // Case 1: Valid credentials
                { "invaliduser", "wrongpassword", false }     // Case 2: Invalid credentials
            };
        }

        // 2. Create the Test method and link it to the Data Provider
        @Test(dataProvider = "loginCredentials")
        public void testLogin(String username, String password, boolean expectedResult) {
            System.out.println("Testing with Username: " + username + ", Password: " + password);
            // In a real test, you would use Selenium to perform the login and get the actual result.
            boolean actualResult = "user@example.com".equals(username) && "password123".equals(password);
            Assert.assertEquals(actualResult, expectedResult);
        }
    }
    ```
    - In this example, the `testLogin` method will be executed **twice**:
        1.  First run: `username` = "user@example.com", `password` = "password123", `expectedResult` = `true`.
        2.  Second run: `username` = "invaliduser", `password` = "wrongpassword", `expectedResult` = `false`.

## Types of Automation Frameworks
- Beyond specific tools like JUnit or TestNG, automation frameworks are designed based on different strategies. Here are the most common types:

### 1. Linear Scripting Framework (Record and Playback)
- **What it is**: The simplest framework where test steps are recorded and played back sequentially.
- **Pros**: Very fast to create initial tests. No programming knowledge is needed.
- **Cons**: Not scalable. Scripts are not reusable, and any small UI change breaks the test.
- **Best for**: Simple, one-off tasks or learning automation concepts.
- **Example**: Using Selenium IDE to record a login sequence.

### 2. Modular Driven Framework
- **What it is**: The application is broken down into smaller, independent modules (or functions). A separate, reusable test script is created for each module.
- **Pros**: High reusability. Easier to maintain since a change in one module only requires updating that specific script.
- **Cons**: Requires more planning and setup time.
- **Example**: Creating a `login()` function and a `logout()` function that can be called by multiple test cases.

### 3. Data-Driven Framework
- **What it is**: Test logic is separated from the test data. The same test script can be run multiple times with different data inputs.
- **How it works**: Test data is stored in external files like Excel, CSV, or a database. The framework reads the data and passes it to the test scripts.
- **Pros**: Reduces the number of scripts. Easy to add new test cases by just adding a new row of data.
- **Example**: Using TestNG's `@DataProvider` to read login credentials from a CSV file.

### 4. Keyword-Driven Framework
- **What it is**: An application-independent framework that uses keywords (action words) to describe the actions to be performed.
- **How it works**: Keywords like `login`, `clickButton`, and `verifyText` are defined in a library. Testers (even non-technical ones) can create test cases by combining these keywords in a table (like an Excel sheet).
- **Pros**: Highly reusable. Easy for non-programmers to write tests.
- **Cons**: High initial setup complexity.

### 5. Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) Framework
- **What it is**: A framework that focuses on the application's behavior from the user's perspective. It encourages collaboration between developers, QAs, and business analysts.
- **How it works**: Test cases are written in a natural, human-readable language called Gherkin, using `Given-When-Then` syntax. These plain-text feature files are then linked to the underlying test code (called step definitions).
- **Pros**: Tests are easy to understand for everyone, promoting a shared understanding of requirements.
- **Popular Tools**: Cucumber, JBehave, SpecFlow.
- **Example (`login.feature` file)**:
    ```gherkin
    Feature: User Login
      Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
        Given I am on the login page
        When I enter "user@example.com" and "password123"
        Then I should be redirected to the dashboard
    ```

### Deep Dive: BDD with Cucumber and Gherkin
- **What is Cucumber?**
    - Cucumber is a popular BDD tool that allows you to write tests in a human-readable format called Gherkin. It acts as a bridge between the business-facing feature specifications and the underlying test automation code.

- **What is Gherkin?**
    - Gherkin is the structured, plain-text language used to write test scenarios. Its purpose is to ensure that test cases are documented in a way that can be easily understood by non-technical stakeholders.

- **Key Gherkin Keywords:**
    - `Feature`: A high-level description of a software feature.
    - `Scenario`: A specific example illustrating a business rule.
    - `Given`: Sets up the initial state or precondition.
    - `When`: Describes an action performed by the user.
    - `Then`: Specifies the expected outcome or result.
    - `And`, `But`: Used to add more conditions to any `Given`, `When`, or `Then` step.
    - `Background`: A set of steps that run before *each* scenario in a feature file (e.g., logging in).

- **How it Connects: Feature Files and Step Definitions**
    - **1. Feature File (`.feature`)**: You write your test scenarios here using Gherkin syntax.
    - **2. Step Definition File (`.java`)**: This Java file contains the implementation code for each Gherkin step. Cucumber uses annotations (`@Given`, `@When`, `@Then`) to link the plain-text steps from the feature file to the Java methods that execute the browser actions.

- **Example:**
    - **`login.feature` file:**
    ```gherkin
    Feature: User Login
      Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
        Given I am on the login page
        When I enter "user@example.com" in the username field
        And I enter "password123" in the password field
        And I click the login button
        Then I should see the dashboard page
    ```
    - **`LoginStepDefinitions.java` file:**
    ```java
    import io.cucumber.java.en.*;

    public class LoginStepDefinitions {
        // WebDriver setup would be here...

        @Given("I am on the login page")
        public void i_am_on_the_login_page() { /* Selenium code to navigate to the login URL */ }

        @When("I enter {string} in the username field")
        public void i_enter_username(String username) { /* Selenium code to find username field and type */ }

        @When("I enter {string} in the password field")
        public void i_enter_password(String password) { /* Selenium code to find password field and type */ }

        @When("I click the login button")
        public void i_click_the_login_button() { /* Selenium code to click the login button */ }

        @Then("I should see the dashboard page")
        public void i_should_see_the_dashboard_page() { /* Selenium code to verify dashboard is visible */ }
    }
    ```

### 6. Hybrid Framework
- **What it is**: A combination of two or more of the above frameworks to leverage their respective strengths. This is the most common approach in modern test automation.
- **Pros**: Very flexible and scalable.
- **Cons**: Can be complex to design and maintain.
- **Example**: A framework that uses Cucumber (BDD) for feature files, reads test data from Excel (Data-Driven), and uses modular functions for its step definitions (Modular).

## Common Design Patterns in Automation

### Page Object Model (POM)
- **What it is**: A design pattern, not a framework itself, used to create an object repository for the UI elements of an application. It is the most widely used pattern for enhancing test maintenance and reducing code duplication.

- **How it works**:
    - **Page Classes**: For each page of your application (e.g., Login Page, Home Page), you create a corresponding Java class.
    - **Element Locators**: This class holds all the locators (e.g., `By.id("username")`) for the web elements on that specific page.
    - **Page Methods**: The class also contains public methods that represent the services or actions the page offers (e.g., `login(String user, String pass)`). The test scripts will call these methods, not interact with the elements directly.

- **Why use it? (Pros)**:
    - **Maintainability**: If a UI element's locator changes (e.g., an ID is updated), you only need to fix it in one place: the corresponding Page Class. Without POM, you would have to find and update it in every single test that uses it.
    - **Readability**: Test scripts become clean and easy to understand. They describe the *intent* of the test, not the implementation details. For example, `loginPage.performLogin("user", "pass")` is much clearer than a series of `findElement` and `sendKeys` commands.
    - **Reusability**: You can reuse the page methods across multiple test cases, which eliminates duplicate code.

- **Example Structure**:
    - **`LoginPage.java` (The Page Class)**
    ```java
    public class LoginPage {
        private WebDriver driver;

        // Locators
        private By usernameField = By.id("username");
        private By passwordField = By.id("password");
        private By loginButton = By.id("login-button");

        // Constructor, methods...
    }
    ```
    - **`LoginTest.java` (The Test Class)**
    ```java
    public class LoginTest {
        // WebDriver and Page Objects would be initialized in a @BeforeEach method
        @Test
        public void testSuccessfulLogin() {
            LoginPage loginPage = new LoginPage(driver);
            loginPage.enterUsername("standard_user");
            loginPage.enterPassword("secret_sauce");
            DashboardPage dashboardPage = loginPage.clickLoginButton();
            Assert.assertTrue(dashboardPage.isUserLoggedIn());
        }
        // WebDriver would be closed in an @AfterEach method
    }
    ```

## Core Selenium WebDriver Concepts

### 1. Selenium Locators
- Locators are the core of Selenium. They are the mechanism by which you find and interact with HTML elements on a web page.
- **8 Types of Locators**:
    1.  **`id`**: The most reliable and fastest locator. IDs should be unique on a page. `By.id("login-button")`
    2.  **`name`**: Finds elements by their `name` attribute. `By.name("username")`
    3.  **`className`**: Finds elements by their `class` attribute. Be careful if a class is used on multiple elements. `By.className("input-error")`
    4.  **`tagName`**: Finds elements by their HTML tag (e.g., `<a>`, `<div>`, `<input>`). `By.tagName("a")`
    5.  **`linkText`**: Finds an anchor tag (`<a>`) by its exact visible text. `By.linkText("Forgot Password?")`
    6.  **`partialLinkText`**: Finds an anchor tag (`<a>`) by a partial match of its visible text. `By.partialLinkText("Forgot")`
    7.  **`cssSelector`**: A powerful and fast locator that uses CSS selector syntax to find elements. Often the best choice when an ID is not available. `By.cssSelector("input#username")`
    8.  **`xpath`**: The most flexible locator, which can navigate the entire HTML DOM. It can be slower than CSS selectors and should be used when no other locator works. `By.xpath("//input[@id='username']")`

### 2. Finding Elements: `findElement` vs `findElements`
- **`findElement(By locator)`**:
    - Finds the **first** web element that matches the locator.
    - Returns a single `WebElement` object.
    - If no element is found, it throws a `NoSuchElementException`.
- **`findElements(By locator)`**:
    - Finds **all** web elements that match the locator.
    - Returns a `List<WebElement>`.
    - If no elements are found, it returns an **empty list** (it does not throw an exception).

### 3. Handling Dynamic Elements with Waits
- Modern web pages are dynamic. Elements may take time to load, appear, or become clickable. Waits are essential to prevent `NoSuchElementException` and create stable, reliable tests.
- **Implicit Wait**:
    - Tells WebDriver to wait for a certain amount of time *before* throwing an exception if an element is not immediately found.
    - It's a global setting, applied to all `findElement` calls for the entire session.
    - **Usage**: `driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(Duration.ofSeconds(10));`
    - **Con**: Can slow down tests if used with a long timeout, as it will wait for the full duration for elements that truly don't exist.
- **Explicit Wait**:
    - The preferred approach. It waits for a specific *condition* to be met before proceeding. It's applied only where you define it.
    - Uses the `WebDriverWait` and `ExpectedConditions` classes.
    - **Usage**:
        ```java
        WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, Duration.ofSeconds(10));
        WebElement element = wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.id("my-element")));
        ```
    - **Pro**: More intelligent and flexible. You can wait for visibility, clickability, text to be present, etc.

### 4. Common WebDriver Commands
- **`driver.get("URL")`**: Navigates the browser to a specific URL.
- **`driver.getTitle()`**: Gets the title of the current page.
- **`driver.getCurrentUrl()`**: Gets the URL of the current page.
- **`driver.close()` vs `driver.quit()`**:
    - **`driver.close()`**: Closes the currently focused browser window or tab. If it's the only window open, it will also quit the browser session.
    - **`driver.quit()`**: Closes **all** browser windows/tabs opened by the WebDriver session and safely ends the session, terminating the `chromedriver` process. **This is the command you should almost always use in your `@After...` methods to ensure proper cleanup.**

## Test Strategy and Verification

### The Test Pyramid
- A model that helps structure your test suite for efficiency and stability. It suggests the proportion of tests you should have at different levels.
    1.  **Unit Tests (Base)**:
        - The largest part of the pyramid.
        - Tests individual methods or classes in isolation.
        - They are fast, reliable, and easy to maintain.
    2.  **Integration / Service Tests (Middle)**:
        - Fewer than unit tests.
        - Tests how different components or services work together (e.g., how your code interacts with a database or an external API).
        - Slower than unit tests but faster than UI tests.
    3.  **UI / End-to-End Tests (Top)**:
        - The smallest part of the pyramid.
        - Tests the entire application flow from the user's perspective (e.g., using Selenium).
        - They are slow, can be brittle (prone to breaking), and are expensive to run and maintain. Only use them for critical user journeys.

### Assertions: Verifying Outcomes
- An assertion is a statement that verifies if the actual outcome of a test matches the expected outcome. If the assertion fails, the test is marked as failed.
- **Hard Assertions**:
    - This is the default behavior in both JUnit and TestNG (`Assert.assertEquals`, `Assert.assertTrue`, etc.).
    - When a hard assertion fails, the test method is **immediately aborted**, and subsequent steps in that method are not executed.
    - **Use Case**: Best for critical checks where the rest of the test cannot proceed if the assertion fails (e.g., verifying a successful login before testing dashboard features).
- **Soft Assertions (TestNG)**:
    - Allows the test to continue executing even after an assertion fails. It collects all failures and reports them at the end of the test.
    - Implemented using the `SoftAssert` class in TestNG.
    - **Use Case**: Ideal for verifying multiple, independent things on a single page where one failure shouldn't stop you from checking the others (e.g., checking the text of a title, a header, and a footer all at once).
    - **Example**:
        ```java
        SoftAssert softAssert = new SoftAssert();
        softAssert.assertEquals(actualTitle, "Expected Title"); // Will not stop here if it fails
        softAssert.assertTrue(header.isDisplayed());
        softAssert.assertAll(); // Reports all failures collected so far and fails the test if any exist
        ```

## Version Control with Git for Testers
- **What is Git?**
    - Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code. For testers, it's essential for managing automation code, collaborating with developers, and integrating with CI/CD pipelines.
- **Why do testers need it?**
    - **Code Management**: To save and track changes to your Selenium, REST Assured, or other test scripts.
    - **Collaboration**: To work on the same automation codebase with other testers and developers without overwriting each other's work.
    - **Branching**: To create isolated branches to develop new tests for a new feature without affecting the main test suite.
    - **CI/CD Integration**: Jenkins and other CI tools rely on Git to get the latest code to build and test.
- **Most Common Git Commands for Testers**:
    - `git clone <repository-url>`: Downloads a copy of the project from a remote repository (like GitHub) to your local machine.
    - `git pull`: Fetches the latest changes from the remote repository and merges them into your current branch.
    - `git branch <branch-name>`: Creates a new branch.
    - `git checkout <branch-name>`: Switches to a different branch.
    - `git add .`: Stages all your changed files, preparing them to be committed.
    - `git commit -m "Your descriptive message"`: Saves your staged changes to your local repository with a message explaining what you did.
    - `git push`: Uploads your committed changes from your local branch to the remote repository.

### Troubleshooting and Advanced Commands
    - `git status`: Shows the current state of your working directory and staging area. It tells you which files are modified, staged, or untracked.
    - `git log`: Displays the commit history for the current branch. Use `git log --oneline` for a compact view.
    - **Undoing Changes**:
        - `git reset <file>`: Unstages a file, but keeps the changes in your working directory.
        - `git checkout -- <file>`: Discards all changes in a file in your working directory, reverting it to the last committed version. **Use with caution, as this is destructive.**
        - `git revert <commit-hash>`: Creates a new commit that undoes the changes from a specific previous commit. This is the safest way to undo changes on a shared branch because it doesn't alter the project history.
    - **Handling Merge Conflicts**:
        - When a `git pull` or `git merge` results in a conflict, Git will mark the conflicting files.
        - Open the marked file(s) in your editor. You will see markers like `<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>`.
        - Manually edit the file to resolve the conflict, keeping the code you want and removing the markers.
        - Once resolved, use `git add <conflicted-file>` and `git commit` to finalize the merge.
    - **Removing Large Files from History**:
        - **Problem**: You accidentally committed a large file (e.g., a video or a JAR file), and now your repository is huge. A simple `git rm` and a new commit won't fix it, because the file still exists in the repository's history.
        - **Solution**: You need to rewrite the repository's history to remove the file from all commits. The modern, recommended tool for this is `git-filter-repo`.
        - **Example Steps (using `git-filter-repo`)**:
            1.  Install `git-filter-repo` (it's a separate tool).
            2.  Run the command: `git filter-repo --path /path/to/your/large-file --invert-paths`
            3.  This will go through your entire history and remove the specified file.
            4.  You will then need to force-push the changes to the remote repository: `git push --force`. **Warning**: Force-pushing is dangerous and should only be done if you are coordinating with your entire team, as it rewrites the shared history.

## CI/CD and Jenkins for Testers
- As a tester, understanding the Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline is crucial because it's where your automated tests provide the most value.

### What is CI/CD?
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**:
    - A development practice where developers frequently merge their code changes into a central repository (like Git).
    - After each merge, an automated build and automated tests are run.
    - **Goal**: To find and address bugs quicker, improve software quality, and reduce the time it takes to validate and release new software updates.
- **Continuous Delivery (CD)**:
    - An extension of CI. It's a practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for a release to production.
    - The final step—deploying to a live production environment—is triggered manually.
    - **Goal**: To ensure you can release new changes to your customers quickly and sustainably.
- **Continuous Deployment (also CD)**:
    - The next step after Continuous Delivery. Every change that passes all stages of your production pipeline is released to your customers automatically. There's no human intervention.

### What is Jenkins?
- Jenkins is an open-source automation server that acts as the engine for CI/CD.
- It automates the different stages of your delivery pipeline, such as building the code, running tests, and deploying the application.
- A pipeline is defined in a special file called a **`Jenkinsfile`**, which lives in your project's code repository. This is known as "Pipeline as Code".

### A Typical CI/CD Pipeline for a Tester
1.  **Commit**: A developer commits code to a Git repository.
2.  **Trigger**: The commit automatically triggers a Jenkins pipeline (via a webhook).
3.  **Build**: Jenkins checks out the latest code and uses Maven to compile it (`mvn compile`).
4.  **Unit Test**: Jenkins runs all the fast unit tests (`mvn test`). If any test fails, the pipeline stops and notifies the team. The build is "broken".
5.  **Package & Deploy to QA**: If unit tests pass, Jenkins packages the application (`mvn package`) and deploys it to a dedicated QA/testing environment.
6.  **Run Automated E2E/UI Tests**: This is where your Selenium suite comes in! Jenkins executes your regression suite against the newly deployed application in the QA environment.
    - For example, Jenkins might run the command: `mvn test -P e2e-tests` (where `e2e-tests` is a profile in your `pom.xml` configured to run your TestNG/Selenium tests).
7.  **Publish Reports**: After the tests are complete, Jenkins publishes the test results (e.g., TestNG reports), code coverage reports, and other artifacts.
8.  **Notify**: The team is notified of the pipeline status (e.g., via Slack or email). If the E2E tests failed, the team can review the reports to see what broke.
9.  **Manual Promotion (Continuous Delivery)**: If all tests pass, the build is marked as "stable" and is ready to be deployed to production with a single click.

### Why is this important for you?
- **Immediate Feedback**: Your tests provide immediate feedback on the health of the application after every single change.
- **Find Regressions Fast**: You catch bugs introduced by new code almost instantly, not days or weeks later.
- **Reliable and Repeatable**: Your tests run in a consistent, automated environment, eliminating "it works on my machine" problems.
- **Enables "Shift-Left" Testing**: By integrating tests early in the pipeline, you are "shifting left"—moving testing closer to the development phase, which is cheaper and more efficient.

## API Testing Fundamentals (The Postman Basics)
- Before diving into API test automation, it's important to understand the core components you interact with, often first explored using tools like Postman.

### Anatomy of an API Request
- An API request is like placing an order with a waiter (the API). It has several parts:
    1.  **HTTP Method**: The verb that tells the server what action to perform.
        -   `GET`: Retrieve data.
        -   `POST`: Create new data.
        -   `PUT`: Update existing data completely.
        -   `DELETE`: Remove data.
    2.  **Endpoint**: The specific URL where the request is sent (e.g., `https://api.example.com/users`).
    3.  **Headers**: Key-value pairs that send metadata about your request.
        -   `Content-Type`: Tells the server the format of your request body (e.g., `application/json`).
        -   `Authorization`: Carries credentials to prove who you are. This is where you put **Bearer Tokens** or **Basic Auth** information.
        -   `X-API-Key`: A common header for sending an **API Key**.
    4.  **Query Parameters**: Key-value pairs added to the end of the URL to filter or customize a `GET` request. They start with `?` and are separated by `&`.
        -   **Example**: `https://api.example.com/users?status=active&sort=name`
    5.  **Request Body**: The data sent to the server with `POST` or `PUT` requests, usually in JSON format.
        -   **Example JSON Body**:
            ```json
            {
                "name": "New User",
                "email": "new.user@example.com"
            }
            ```

### Anatomy of an API Response
- After processing the request, the server sends back a response, which includes:
    1.  **Status Code**: A 3-digit number indicating the result of the request. As a tester, you should be familiar with the most common ones:
        | Code | Category | Name | What it Means |
        | --- | --- | --- | --- |
        | **200** | **Success** | **OK** | The request succeeded. The standard response for successful GET requests. |
        | **201** | **Success** | **Created** | The request succeeded, and a new resource was created as a result (e.g., after a POST). |
        | **204** | **Success** | **No Content** | The server successfully processed the request but is not returning any content (e.g., after a DELETE). |
        | **301** | **Redirection** | **Moved Permanently** | The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new URL. |
        | **302** | **Redirection** | **Found** | The requested resource is temporarily at a different URL. |
        | **400** | **Client Error** | **Bad Request** | The server cannot process the request due to a client error (e.g., malformed JSON, invalid parameters). |
        | **401** | **Client Error** | **Unauthorized** | You are not authenticated. You need to provide valid credentials (like a Bearer Token or API Key) to access the resource. |
        | **403** | **Client Error** | **Forbidden** | You are authenticated, but you do not have permission to access this resource. It's a permissions issue, not an authentication issue. |
        | **404** | **Client Error** | **Not Found** | The server cannot find the requested resource or endpoint. |
        | **405** | **Client Error** | **Method Not Allowed** | The HTTP method you used (e.g., GET, POST) is not supported for the requested resource. |
        | **409** | **Client Error** | **Conflict** | The request could not be completed because of a conflict with the current state of the resource (e.g., trying to create a user with an email that already exists). |
        | **415** | **Client Error** | **Unsupported Media Type** | The server is rejecting the request because the request body is in a format not supported by the requested resource. |
        | **429** | **Client Error** | **Too Many Requests** | The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time (rate limiting). |
        | **500** | **Server Error** | **Internal Server Error** | A generic error on the server's side. It means something went wrong on the server, and it's not your fault. |
        | **502** | **Server Error** | **Bad Gateway** | The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from an inbound server it accessed. |
        | **503** | **Server Error** | **Service Unavailable** | The server is currently unable to handle the request due to being overloaded or down for maintenance. |
        | **504** | **Server Error** | **Gateway Timeout** | The server, while acting as a gateway, did not get a response in time from the upstream server. |
    2.  **Response Body**: The data or message sent back from the server (e.g., the user data you requested).
    3.  **Response Headers**: Metadata about the response (e.g., `Content-Type`, `Date`).

## API Testing with REST Assured
- **What is REST Assured?**
    - REST Assured is a popular open-source Java library specifically designed for testing RESTful APIs. It provides a simple, domain-specific language (DSL) that makes writing powerful and readable API tests easy.

    - It simplifies the process of making HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and validating the responses.

- **Why use it for API Testing?**
    - **Readable BDD Syntax**: It uses a `Given-When-Then` syntax, similar to Cucumber, which makes tests easy to read and understand even for non-developers.
    - **Java Integration**: Being a Java library, it integrates seamlessly with existing Java-based automation frameworks like JUnit or TestNG.
    - **No Boilerplate Code**: It handles a lot of the setup and teardown code (like creating an HTTP client, sending requests, and parsing responses) for you, so you can focus on the test logic.
    - **Powerful Assertions**: It has rich support for validating response data, including status codes, headers, cookies, and complex JSON/XML body content using tools like JSONPath and XMLPath.

- **Core Concepts: The Given/When/Then Structure**
    - **`Given()`**: This is where you set up the request preconditions. This includes setting headers, authentication, cookies, or request body content.
    - **`When()`**: This is where you specify the HTTP method and the endpoint URL. This is the action part of the test.
    - **`Then()`**: This is where you validate the response. You can assert the status code, check headers, and verify the response body content.

- **Example: A Simple GET Request**
    - Let's say we want to test the public API `https://reqres.in/` to get user data.

    ```java
    import io.restassured.RestAssured;
    import org.testng.annotations.Test;
    import static io.restassured.RestAssured.*;
    import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.*;

    public class ApiTest {

        @Test
        public void testGetUser() {
            // Set the base URI for the API
            RestAssured.baseURI = "https://reqres.in/api";

            given().
                // No specific preconditions for this simple GET request
            when().
                get("/users/2"). // Send a GET request to the endpoint
            then().
                statusCode(200). // Assert that the status code is 200 (OK)
                body("data.id", equalTo(2)). // Assert the 'id' in the response body is 2
                body("data.first_name", equalTo("Janet")); // Assert the 'first_name'
        }
    }
    ```

- **Adding REST Assured to your Project**
    - To use REST Assured, you just need to add its dependency to your `pom.xml` file.

    ```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.rest-assured</groupId>
        <artifactId>rest-assured</artifactId>
        <version>5.4.0</version> <!-- Or the latest version -->
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
    ```
